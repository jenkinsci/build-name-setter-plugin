    Normally, builds are named by their sequential numbers, but you can change that here by
    setting what name new build gets. This field can contain the following macros:

    <help xmlns="/lib/token-macro" />

    For multi-configuration projects: if the Matrix Build Name is set and the Build 
    Name field is not set, then the head build and child builds will all use the Matrix Build 
    Name's pattern.
    
    If both the Matrix Build Name and default build name are set, then the Matrix Build Name
    will only apply to the head build and child builds will use the value of the Build Name 
    field. This is useful if child builds will take their name from a dynamically generated 
    file.
